+ [ ] [CMU15_445-fa22](https://github.com/shejialuo/CMU15_445-fa22)
  This course teaches the implementation of the DBMS and how to write a DB. However,
  the instructor insists that the repository should be private. So this resository
  is private, if you want to know the implementation please send the email to me.

  This course teaches the implementation about the TCP/IP. You will implement a
  TCP/IP stack by yourself.
+ [x] [CS161-su20](https://github.com/shejialuo/CS161-su20)
  This course teaches the basic idea about the security. You will learn the security
  from many perspectives and do it in action.
  + How to exploit binary bugs.
  + How to implement network attacks.
  + How to implement a security shared file system.
+ [x] [MIT_6.858-sp20](https://github.com/shejialuo/MIT_6.858-sp20)
  This course teaches how to implement a security application with many papers:
  + How to exploit binary bugs.
  + How to implement privilege separation.
  + How to realize symbolic execution.

  This course teaches you how to implement a compiler in action.
+ [ ] [Data100-fa21](https://github.com/shejialuo/Data100-fa21)
  This course teaches you about data science. I think it is a good course to
  broaden my horizon.

## Courses From The Other
